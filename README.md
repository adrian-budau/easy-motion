# Easy Motion for [Atom](https://atom.io). Speed++
#### Inspired from [Vim-EasyMotion](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-easymotion) by [Kim Silkeb√¶kken](https://github.com/Lokaltog).

Check out that repository to better understand what this plugin does.

To start easy-motion press **Shift+Cmd+E**. Rebind this in settings to better suit you. By default the characters that replace words are **ABC....Z**. You can replace this if you want, also from settings.
