* Fixed bugs, now you can really search with lowercase chars when you have only uppercase (and viceversa)
* You can now reverse search words (move the cursor to the end of words) using cmd+shift+y
* You can also search from the find-and-replace panel, just press cmd+shift+e or cmd+shift+y from find-and-replace
* You can use page-down and page-up while using easy-motion to move around the editor view

## 1.0.0

* Initial release, working but missing features
